define ('OSITESS', 'I guess many of us know the history of face-mash, on this site in real time compared students from one university. 
So this is the idea and formed the basis of this project. But the development is quite different. 

The contest itself is divided into 2 stages: 

1. Register. 
At this stage, we collect the forms for the contest. 
We decided that comparing the boy and the girl is not quite humanely, because questionnaires are divided into boys and girls. 

2. The voting itself. 
Voting is as follows: each time the page refreshes, you will get 2 photos (2 boys and 2 girls), choose the best and click on it - the page refreshes and the circle is closed. 

At the initial stage of each of the contestants and 1000 points for each participating he poluchet + or - depending on whether it will enjoy the photo or not. When the score questionnaire is <= 0 - the questionnaire is removed. 
Contest lasts as long as there will be two contestants - 1 girl and 1 boy. 
Winners receive a tablet <b>Samsung GALAXY Tab</b> ');
